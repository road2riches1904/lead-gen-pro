### Outreach Strategies

#### Cold Email (Primary Method)

**Subject Lines That Work**:
- "100 pre-qualified leads for [Company]?"
- "Quick question about your lead generation"
- "[Company Name] - Free lead sample inside"
- "How much is a qualified lead worth to you?"

**Email Template 1 (Discovery)**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much is a qualified lead worth to [Company Name]?

I ask because I've developed an AI system that generates 100+ qualified leads per month for [Industry] companies.

Would you be interested in seeing 10 sample leads from your target market? No cost, no obligation - just want to show you the quality.

If they're good, we can discuss a monthly program starting at $299.

Worth a quick look?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email Template 2 (Problem-Focused)**:
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] specializes in [their service]. Most companies in your space struggle with one of these:

1. Lead generation is too expensive
2. Lead quality is inconsistent  
3. Not enough leads coming in

Which one hits closest to home?

I've helped [industry] companies solve this with an AI-powered lead generation system. Happy to share some examples if you're interested.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

#### LinkedIn Outreach

**Connection Request**:
"Hi [Name], I help [industry] companies generate qualified leads. Would love to connect and share some insights."

**Follow-up Message**:
"Thanks for connecting! I saw [Company Name] works with [their target market]. I have an AI system that's generating 100+ qualified leads/month for similar companies. Would you be interested in seeing some sample leads?"

#### Cold Calling Script

**Opening**:
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I specialize in helping [industry] companies generate qualified leads through AI automation. Do you have 30 seconds for a quick question?"

**The Question**:
"How much would it be worth to your business if I could guarantee 100 qualified leads per month in your target market?"

**The Hook**:
"I've developed an AI system that's doing exactly that for companies like yours. Would you be interested in seeing 10 sample leads from your ideal customers?"

### Sales Process

#### Step 1: Lead Magnet (Free Sample)
- Offer 10 free qualified leads
- Collect their ideal customer criteria
- Deliver within 24 hours
- Include lead scores and contact info

#### Step 2: Follow-up Call
- "How did those sample leads look?"
- Understand their current lead gen process
- Identify pain points and costs
- Present solution and pricing

#### Step 3: Demo/Proof
- Show your dashboard live
- Walk through lead generation process
- Demonstrate quality scoring
- Share client testimonials

#### Step 4: Close
- "Based on what you've seen, which plan makes the most sense for your business?"
- Handle objections (see below)
- Get commitment and payment details
- Schedule onboarding call

### Objection Handling

#### "It's too expensive"
**Response**: "I understand cost is a concern. Let's look at the math - if just 5 of our 100 monthly leads convert for you, and each client is worth $2,000, that's $10,000 in revenue for a $299 investment. What's your typical conversion rate?"

#### "We already have a lead source"
**Response**: "That's great! What we've found is that successful companies never rely on just one lead source. Our system is designed to complement what you're already doing. Think of it as diversifying your lead generation, just like you'd diversify an investment portfolio."

#### "I need to think about it"
**Response**: "I completely understand. What specific concerns do you have? Is it the pricing, the quality, or something else? Maybe I can address those concerns now."

#### "We don't have budget right now"
**Response**: "I get it. When do you typically review your marketing budget? In the meantime, would you like me to continue sending you the free leads so you can see the quality and calculate the potential ROI?"
