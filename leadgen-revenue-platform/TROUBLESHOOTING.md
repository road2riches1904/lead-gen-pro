## 🚨 Emergency Issues (Fix Immediately)

### Platform Won't Start
**Symptoms**: Error messages when running `bun run dev`

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Clear Cache**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm bun.lockb
   bun install
   ```

3. **Check Environment File**
   - Ensure `.env` file exists
   - Verify all required variables are set
   - No extra spaces or quotes around values

4. **Check Port Conflicts**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000  # Check if port 3000 is in use
   bun run dev --port 3001  # Use different port
   ```

### Database Connection Failed
**Symptoms**: "Database connection error" in console

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Supabase Credentials**
   - Check `SUPABASE_URL` in `.env`
   - Check `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env`

2. **Create Missing Tables**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS leads (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     name TEXT,
     email TEXT,
     company TEXT,
     industry TEXT,
     score INTEGER,
     source TEXT,
     status TEXT DEFAULT 'new',
     estimated_value NUMERIC,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
   );
   ```
