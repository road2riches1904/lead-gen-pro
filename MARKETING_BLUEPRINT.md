## üìß Automated Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Real Estate Agents

**Subject**: Quick question about your lead generation üè†

Hi [Name],

I saw your recent post about [specific reference to their content/challenge]. 

I help real estate agents like yourself get 20-50 qualified buyer/seller leads per month on complete autopilot - no cold calling, no door knocking, just qualified prospects delivered to your inbox.

One of my clients, [Agent Name] in [City], went from 2 closings a month to 8 closings using this system.

Worth a quick 15-minute call to see if this could work for you?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. I only work with 3-4 agents per market to avoid conflicts, so if you're interested, let's connect soon.

### Template 2: Insurance Agents

**Subject**: 47 new insurance leads last month? ‚úÖ

Hi [Name],

Quick question - are you generating enough qualified insurance leads each month, or could you use 30-50 more?

I just helped an agent in [nearby city] go from struggling to find prospects to having a waiting list of qualified leads wanting quotes.

The system runs completely on autopilot - no cold calling required.

Interested in a brief call to see how this could work for your business?

[Your Name]

### Template 3: Marketing Agencies

**Subject**: White-label lead generation for your clients?

Hi [Name],

I noticed you work with [type of clients]. 

Are any of them asking for help with lead generation? I have a white-label system that generates 50-200 qualified B2B leads per month that you could resell to your clients.

Several agencies are making an extra $5K-15K per month offering this as a service.

Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]

## üí¨ Sales Conversation Framework

### Phase 1: Discovery (5 minutes)

**Questions to Ask**:
- "How are you currently generating leads for your business?"
- "What's your biggest challenge with lead generation right now?"
- "How many qualified leads would you need each month to hit your goals?"
- "What's your current budget for marketing/lead generation?"
- "How do you typically qualify and follow up with leads?"

**Listen for pain points**:
- Inconsistent lead flow
- Poor lead quality
- Too much time spent on lead generation
- High cost per lead
- Manual processes

### Phase 2: Present Solution (10 minutes)

**Key Points**:
1. **Automation**: "This runs 24/7 without your involvement"
2. **Quality**: "Every lead is pre-qualified based on your exact criteria"
3. **Delivery**: "Leads delivered to your email/dashboard with full contact info"
4. **Guarantee**: "If you don't get at least [X] qualified leads in month 1, I'll refund your money"

**Social Proof**:
- "[Client name] in [industry] got 47 qualified leads last month"
- "One client closed $23,000 in business from leads I generated"
- "Average client sees 3x ROI within 60 days"

### Phase 3: Pricing & Close (5 minutes)

**Pricing Strategy**:
- Start with mid-tier: "$997/month gets you 50-100 qualified leads"
- If price resistance: "I also have a starter package at $497 for 25 leads"
- If budget is higher: "For enterprises, I have a $1997 package with 200+ leads"

**Closing Questions**:
- "Does this sound like something that could help your business?"
